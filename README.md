# Fortress of the Infernal Sanctum

![Fortress of the Infernal Sanctum](patches/m_doom.png)

A single large map for GZDoom featuring defensive fortress architecture, ~1052 enemies, an adaptive music system with 18 segments, and a cinematic title screen with a scale maquette diorama.

If you find it difficult, skill levels are implemented - try HNTR. Or if you just want to blaze through it.

### Note about releases
There are three different variants available:
* fotis.pk3 -- this is the best, contains audio as 24-bit FLAC (RECOMMENDED)
* fotis-ogg.pk3 -- this version contains audio compressed with Ogg Vorbis (if somehow a few megabytes matters to you in this current year)
* fotis-nomusic.pk3 -- this version contains no audio files at all (if you must have the smallest possible download)
