# Fortress of the Infernal Sanctum

![Fortress of the Infernal Sanctum](patches/m_doom.png)

A galaxy hangs over the battlements. Breach the fortress. Survive the shifting cells. Cross the drawbridge. Fight your way to the Infernal Sanctum - and the horde that guards it.

A single large map for GZDoom with 1000+ enemies on UV (500 on HNTR, full skill level support). Original electronic score with adaptive music that builds as you progress. 

The title screen presents the fortress as a scale model:

### Note about releases
There are three different variants available:
* fotis.pk3 -- this is the best, contains audio as 24-bit FLAC (RECOMMENDED)
* fotis-ogg.pk3 -- this version contains audio compressed with Ogg Vorbis (if somehow a few megabytes matters to you in this current year)
* fotis-nomusic.pk3 -- this version contains no audio files at all (if you must have the smallest possible download)
